# Loan Approval Prediction

**Problem Statement:**  
Banks face challenges in efficiently assessing loan applications due to multiple applicant factors such as income, credit score, tenure, and assets. Manual evaluation is time-consuming and inconsistent. This project solves the problem by building a machine learning model that predicts loan approval likelihood, enabling faster and more reliable decision-making.

## AIM  
To build a machine learning solution that predicts whether a loan will be approved, while analyzing the most significant factors influencing loan approval decisions.

## TASK â€“ RESULT  

Cleaned raw dataset and removed identifiers â†’ Structured dataset free from inconsistencies  
Transformed and consolidated asset values â†’ Simplified into movable and immovable categories  
Explored applicant details with EDA â†’ Found strong influence of CIBIL score, dependents, and income  
Engineered features and preprocessed data â†’ Built a balanced feature set suitable for modeling  
Trained multiple ML models â†’ Random Forest and XGBoost outperformed others with higher accuracy  
Interpreted model outputs â†’ Identified CIBIL score, income, loan amount, and asset values as key drivers

## RESULT  

Delivered a  prediction model with high accuracy and interpretability. Random Forest and XGBoost provided the best performance, reducing misclassification of applicants. Key factors affecting approval identified were CIBIL score, income, loan amount, and asset values. The solution helps banks speed up approvals, reduce default risk, and prioritize reliable applicants.
